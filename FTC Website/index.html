        <strong>What is a Sergeant-At-Arms?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant-At-Arms (SAAs) are amazing volunteers who are willing to take an active part in helping the district. They make sure that FTC goes on without a hitch by promoting and enforcing safe behavior as listed in the Code of Conduct. Their responsibilities include making rounds around the campground, reporting inappropriate activities, and making sure that each member has a safe experience. Our FTC ohana would be incomplete without these members!

We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation for sharing your time. Once again, thank you for applying and we hope you enjoy the experience!

      <strong>Team Captain Duties</strong>
    <p>
Team Captains should be familiarized with all the games they will be participating in and leading prior to attending Fall Training Conference. As a Team Captain, you will be leading your team of Circle K members (roughly 15, consisting of new and older members) throughout a series of games and challenges presented during the course of the day. Your job is not only to facilitate and encourage bonding between your team members as you participate in games and overcome challenges presented to, but most importantly to have fun!

What we are looking for this year is a DJ who would love to provide a great atmosphere for the other members attending Fall Training Conference while also being able to appeal to an array of musical tastes throughout the night and to also have a good time yourself! Also, a DJ who has their own equipment would be great as well and any help will be provided.
